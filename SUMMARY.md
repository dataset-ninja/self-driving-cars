**Self Driving Cars** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 5000 images with 344334 labeled objects belonging to 13 different classes including _sky_, _road_, _tree,_ and other: **sidewalk*, *car*, *pole*, *road markings*, *building*, *street infrastructure *, *fence*, *wall*, *traffic*, and *pedestrian**.

Each image in the Self Driving Cars dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 5 splits in the dataset: _dataC_ (1000 images), _dataD_ (1000 images), _dataE_ (1000 images), _dataB_ (1000 images), and _dataA_ (1000 images). The dataset was released in 2018.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 13 classes:
