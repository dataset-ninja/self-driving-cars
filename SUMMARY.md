**Semantic Segmentation for Self Driving Cars** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 5000 images with 344334 labeled objects belonging to 13 different classes including *sky*, *road*, *tree*, and other: *sidewalk*, *car*, *pole*, *road markings*, *building*, *street infrastructure*, *fence*, *wall*, *traffic*, and *pedestrian*.

Images in the Self Driving Cars dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2018.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
