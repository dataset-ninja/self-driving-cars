**Self Driving Cars** (Self Driving Cars) is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 5000 images with 344334 labeled objects belonging to 13 different classes including *sky*, *road*, *tree,* and other: *sidewalk, car, pole, road markings, building, street infrastructure , fence, wall, traffic, and pedestrian*.

Each image in the Self Driving Cars dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 0 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 5 splits in the dataset: *dataC* (1000 images), *dataD* (1000 images), *dataE* (1000 images), *dataB* (1000 images), and *dataA* (1000 images). The dataset was released in 2018.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 13 classes:
