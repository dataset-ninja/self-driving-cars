The **Self Driving Cars** dataset comprises images and associated labeled semantic segmentations obtained using the CARLA self-driving car simulator. This dataset was created within the context of the [Lyft Udacity Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/lyft-challenge). It serves as valuable data for training machine learning algorithms to recognize semantic segmentation of objects like cars, roads, and more.
